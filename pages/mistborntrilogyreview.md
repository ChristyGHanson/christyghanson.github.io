A Brief Update on My *Mistborn* Journey: The First Trilogy

Hello, all.
I have just finished reading the second *Mistborn* book by Brandon Sanderson, *Mistborn: The Well of Ascension.* Spending all night flipping through this fat tome was worth several hours of non-stop yawning and coffee-guzzling at my day job. 

The first half of the novel was slow just like the first novel, *Mistborn: The Final Empire*, but Stephan, the one who started it all, insists it's mainly due to the extensive world-building process of this series. He says that Sanderson weighed this book down with elaborate descriptions of Luthadel's governmental or political processes, relationships, and interactions. 

On top of that, much of the text has to support the complex magic system and the chillingly stylish battle sequences of the Mistborn, Allomancers, inquisitors, and koloss. 

Thirdly, Sanderson ensured readers would greedily reread sections of the novels by tantalizing us with brilliant foreshadowing and the subtle conjuring of tasty tidbits in character dialogue. He included maps, glossaries, and story summaries in each novel. 

We are both assured that once a reader patiently wades through these expositions, the *Mistborn* series invariably grows in adventure and excitement that will kill your interest in *Harry Potter* and Netflix for months (but video games are admittedly an exception).
